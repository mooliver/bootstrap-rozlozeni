                    <h1>Slavic Mythology</h1>
                    <p>Slavic mythology is a polytheistic belief system which originated in the Slavic region of Europe. It is based on the ancient beliefs of the Slavic peoples and has been adapted and modified over the centuries. The pantheon of Slavic gods and goddesses is varied and includes deities such as Perun, Veles, Svarog and Radegast as well as a host of other gods and spirits. Legends and stories from Slavic mythology have been passed down orally from generation to generation and have formed the basis of many modern fairy tales.
